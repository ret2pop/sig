Sig
=================================================================================
Sig is the first pronounceable English-like syllable I came up with when making
the local folder, and by extension the repository. The decision to make this
README plaintext is due to readability and the lack of rules. In order to read
a document such as this one, one need only read the words, separated by
punctuation and whitespace in order, and from left to right, reading the next
line if required. The name is short for several things; it can stand for the
word 'significant', or 'signature', or whichever other word you may prefer.

This repository accurately documents the creation of this repository, as it is
self-documenting. This text has at most 70 characters per line because the
writer, Preston Pan, felt that it was natural.
